I met Renfri again. They looked slim and underfed. Godfrey prepared them a meal, while we discussed it. They didn't seem to like taking the food they thought of as Kyrus'. I told them to ask him, if they really wanted to get permission first. Knowing Kyrus, he could say yes, he could say no.

If he says no, though, we'll have a problem.

They have permission to visit Ana and I's place any time.

Went to a meeting with Him, on his side this time.
It went pretty well.
