I was rather rude to Brieze today... 
She was bargaining information for help with our cause;
information that pertained to me and I did not want shared.

I was stressed, as Konrad wanted to see me. I was not sure if
I would be losing my job.

I need to apologize to her...

I spoke with Konrad.
He simply wanted to know some details about the incidents with
Mulrath.
