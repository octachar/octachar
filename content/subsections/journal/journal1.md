The Bloodtide finally sailed. It was beautiful; it was spectacular.
I helped, but I do not think I deserve to feel proud. I did not 
contribute enough to feel that way.

Nothing could have prepared me for what came next.
The captain was confronted by a person who seemed to be the 
previous captain of the Black Fins. I wanted to help; I wanted to 
step in and ensure the captain didn't fall. However, I follow orders.
The orders were that I was not to intervene. At all. I don't know what
happened after, nor the outcome. I got out of there: I couldn't bear to
watch the person who had comforted me mere hours earlier almost die with
nothing I can do to help them.

I jumped into the water surrounding the docks, swimming to the shore and 
hiding next to a tree.

I'm still cold from the frigid waters as I write this.
