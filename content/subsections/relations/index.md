Those I know will need to earn their spot in the picture that is my trust.

| Loved: | The one that lights up my world      |

| **Anaryele** | My love, you are my sun and moon. You keep me going, and I couldn't wish for anything else. Note: Short |

| Close: | The ones I trust; the ones I cherish  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Medea**  | My captain. They are fierce, and will do whatever they can to help their crew.
| **Rio**    | A colleage, a crewmate, a friend. She has helped me in unimaginable ways.

| Friend: | Those who I know, but who lack a portion of trust |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

| **Hazel**     | You saved my life, I wish we knew each other more.           |
| **Tali**      | Silly and fun. I like silly people.                          |
