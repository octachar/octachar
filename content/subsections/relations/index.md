Those I know will need to earn their spot in the picture that is my trust.

| Loved:       | The one that lights up my world                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anaryele** | My love, you are my sun and moon. You keep me going, and I couldn't wish for anything else. Note: Short |

| Close:     | The ones I trust; the ones I cherish  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Medea**  | My captain. They are fierce, and will do whatever they can to help their crew.
| **Rio**    | A colleage, a crewmate, a friend. She has helped me in unimaginable ways.
| **Lia**    | One of my many colleagues at the hospital. She has comforted me beyond what others could do.

| Friend: | Those who I know, but who lack a portion of trust |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Brieze**       | You betrayed me and lost my trust. I don't hold it against you, though. | 
| **Meridy**       | A friend, but not one without flaws.                                    |
| **Valorian**     | Caring. A good friend.                                                  |
| **Asteria**      | A nice kid.                                                             |
| **Godfrey**      | Godfrey. Just Godfrey.                                                  |
| **Elova**        | Kind and caring. Rational, which is a compliment here.                  |
| **Aoi**          | Supportive of me, even if she's not the best at it. I respect that.     |

| Acquaintance: | You are known at the surface, I do not put much trust in you                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Branch**    | Another doctor. Respectable and kind.                                                    |
| **Hazel**     | You saved my life, I wish we knew each other more.                                       |
| **Tali**      | Silly and fun. I like silly people.                                                      |
| **Crow**      | A mercenary. No comment.                                                                 |
| **Cassie**    | Crewmate. Respectable. I wish I had the bravery (or carelessness) to be blunt like that. |

| Untrusted: | Deceiptful and rude |

| **Kyrus**  | Look at the above.  |

| Mulrath:    | A special section for a special boy |

| **Mulrath** | Special.                            |
