Those I know will need to earn their place in the picture that is my trust.

| Loved:       | The one that lights up my world                                                                         | Feeling |

| **Anaryele** | My love, you are my sun and moon. You keep me going, and I couldn't wish for anything else. Note: Short | [When Your Heart Stops Beating - +44](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=usMfopRLM2A&si=SqDywVH6nJ9eEpvL) |

| Close:     | The ones I trust; the ones I cherish                                                          | Feeling |

| **Medea**  | My former captain. They are fierce, and will do whatever they can to help their crew.         |
| **Rio**    | A colleage, a crewmate, a friend. She has helped me in unimaginable ways.                     | [Coming For You - The Offspring](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Df0O70PtVGg&si=B-MdNYVGfyBtSw2d)

| Friend:          | Those who I know, but who lack a portion of trust                                              | Feeling |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Brieze**       | You betrayed me and lost my trust. I don't hold it against you, though.                        | 
| **Meridy**       | A friend. I wouldn't say we're close, but I wouldn't say no to trying.                         |
| **Valorian**     | Caring. A good friend.                                                                         |
| **Asteria**      | A nice kid.                                                                                    |
| **Godfrey**      | Godfrey. Noble, honourable.                                                                    |
| **Elova**        | Kind and caring. Rational, which is a compliment here.                                         |
| **Aoi**          | Supportive of me, even if she's not the best at it. I respect that.                            |
| **Anwar**        | Amazing friend by day, making killer tea by night.                                             | [When You Wish Upon A Star - Ned Washington](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=W4AtLjd_YZU&si=-5LRT1a1X0ptiA5R)
| **Aralei**       | I respect the effort you put into everything. It makes every light shine brighter.             |
| **Serimei**      | Your aptitude with fighting impresses me, even if I have too much pride to admit it.           |
| **Lia**          | One of my many colleagues at the hospital. She has comforted me, but also harmed those I know. |
| **Icarus**       | An amazing fighter. I wish we knew each other better.                                          |

| Acquaintance: | You are known at the surface, I do not put much trust in you                                               |

| **Branch**    | Another doctor. Respectable and kind.                                                                      |
| **Hazel**     | You saved my life, multiple times. I wish we knew each other more.                                         |
| **Tali**      | Silly and fun. I like silly people.                                                                        |
| **Crow**      | A mercenary. No comment.                                                                                   |
| **Cassie**    | Crewmate. Respectable. I wish I had the bravery (or carelessness) to be blunt like that.                   |
| **Cuandi**    | Current captain. That is all.                                                                              |
| **Kyrus**     | Not so bad after all.                                                                                      |
| **Konrad**    | My boss.                                                                                                   |
| **Olivier**   | You're trying to play both sides. There is good to that, but also some nuance I can't ignore.              |
| **Thrudni**   | You do what you can to help, being respectful all the while. You give me hope.                             |
| **Meriel**    | One cannot be corrupt if they aren't in a position of power. What does that make you?                      |
| **Drenmir**   | Reasonable, which I respect.                                                                               |
| **Az'Tur**    | You're respectful and kind. It'd be a gift if we were friends, I just don't know if you trust me enough... |

| Untrusted:   | Deceiptful and rude                                                               | Feeling |

| **Mulrath**  | I *would* wish I was on your good side, if you hadn't tortured me.                | [How Bad Can I Be - Ed Helms](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq-tfxKPN6s&si=P5WjE2kGLworiOBM)
| **Ultio**    | I don't want to hurt you, but you insist in things I need to stop you from doing. |
