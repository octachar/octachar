One was heavily armored, the other was very nimble.\nThe nimble one was first- I tried to restrain it not once, not twice, but three times, with the third being successful. It used all of my energy, but I still had to fight on. It split into four, having been hurt quite badly, and I caught up to one of them just in time to kill it before it ran further towards the spire.\nI took a few hits, but thankfully the bloodweed potion I had drank beforehand prevented most of the injuries. I still had a gash on my hip, not too deep, but still there and bleeding.\nAfterwards, I went to The Roots. Thats where I met Renfri: a bright, strong kid with unfortunate circumstances. I checked in on them after (they had had a seizure while hiding in The Roots), and they were home alone.
